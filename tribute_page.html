		      <ul style="list-style-type: square">
		        <li>Born in September 1907 to a Sikh family in Lyallpur district of Punjab</li>
		        <li>He was deeply influenced by the active participation of his father and uncles in the independence movements of India</li>
		        <li>In 1919, at the tender age of 12, he witnessed the <i>Jallianwala Bagh Massacre</i> which solidified his hatred against the British Rule</li>
		        <li>He followed the Non Co-operation Movement started by <i>Mahatma Gandhi</i> and as a reult left school to enrol in the National College at Lahore</li>
		        <li>Disillusioned with Gandhi's actions of calling-off the movement, he joined the Youth Revolutionary Movement and started advocating violent overthrow of the unjust Govenment</li>
		        <li>He founded the <abbr title="Indian Nationalist Youth Organisation"><i>Naujawan Bharat Sabha</i></abbr> in 1926 and joined the <i>Hindustan Republican Association</i></li>
		        <li>When his family asked him to get married, he left his home stating that his life was now dedicated to the freedom of his country</li>
		        <li>Singh could not believe the violence carried out on the name of religion after witnessing the Hindu-Muslim riots of 1926 and thus dropped his religious beliefs</li>
		        <li>He was a great writer who studied the works of Bakunin, Lenin, Trotsky and often published his views in the revolutionary newspapers such as Veer Arjun, Kirti, and Naujawan Bharat Sabha leaflets</li>
		        <li>As a prominent member of HSRA, he conspired to avenge the wrongful death of <i>Lala Lajpat Rai</i> and as a result killed John P. Saunders, Assistant Superintendent of Police, in Lahore on 1928</li>
		        <li>In April 1929, Singh and an associate bombed the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest implementation of the Public Safety Bill, shouting the slogan <abbr title="Long Live the Revolution"><i>"Inquilab Zindabad!"</i></abbr></li>
		        <li>He was arrested at the scene and later found guilty and sentenced to life in prison</li>
		        <li>Through further investigation in 1929, the police established a connection between Bhagat Singh and the Saunders murder case and thus rearrested him.  </li>
		        <li>While awaiting trial in Central Jail Mianwali, he led a hunger strike in prison citing the discrimination between European and Indian prisoners that carried on for 116 days.</li>
		        <li>Singh and his co-conspirators were then tried and sentenced to hang on 7 October 1930, after the police got statements from his associates, Hans Raj Vohra and Jai Gopal.</li>
		        <li>Bhagat was executed on March 23, 1931 along with  Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar.</li>
		        <li>Today, Singh is considered one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement</li>
		        <li>Every year, March 23, is observed as the <abbr title="Martyrdom day"><i>Shaheedi Divas</i></abbr> of  Shaheed Bhagat Singh in India</li>
